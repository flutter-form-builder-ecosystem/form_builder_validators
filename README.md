> ### Migrating from version 7 to 8
>
> To migrate from v7 to v8, remove `context` as a parameter to validator functions. For example, `FormBuilderValidators.required(context)` becomes `FormBuilderValidators.required()` without context passed to it.

## Features

- Multiple form inputs validators
- Automatic error messages in several languages

## Validators

This package comes with several most common `FormFieldValidator`s such as required, numeric, mail,
URL, min, max, minLength, maxLength, IP, credit card, etc., with default `errorText` messages.

Available built-in validators include:

- `FormBuilderValidators.creditCard()` - requires the field's value to be a valid credit card number.
- `FormBuilderValidators.date()` - requires the field's value to be a valid date string.
- `FormBuilderValidators.email()` - requires the field's value to be a valid email address.
- `FormBuilderValidators.equal()` - requires the field's value be equal to provided object.
- `FormBuilderValidators.integer()` - requires the field's value to be an integer.
- `FormBuilderValidators.ip()` - requires the field's value to be a valid IP address.
- `FormBuilderValidators.match()` - requires the field's value to match the provided regex pattern.
- `FormBuilderValidators.max()` - requires the field's value to be less than or equal to the provided number.
- `FormBuilderValidators.maxLength()` - requires the length of the field's value to be less than or equal to the provided maximum length.
- `FormBuilderValidators.min()` - requires the field's value to be greater than or equal to the provided number.
- `FormBuilderValidators.minLength()` - requires the length of the field's value to be greater than or equal to the provided minimum length.
- `FormBuilderValidators.equalLength()` - requires the length of the field's value to be equal to the provided minimum length.
- `FormBuilderValidators.numeric()` - requires the field's value to be a valid number.
- `FormBuilderValidators.required()` - requires the field have a non-empty value.
- `FormBuilderValidators.url()` - requires the field's value to be a valid url.

## Use

### Setup

To allow for localization of default error messages within your app, add `FormBuilderLocalizations.delegate` in the list of your app's `localizationsDelegates`

```dart
  return MaterialApp(
      supportedLocales: [
        Locale('de'),
        Locale('en'),
        Locale('es'),
        Locale('fr'),
        Locale('it'),
        ...
      ],
      localizationsDelegates: [
        GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
        FormBuilderLocalizations.delegate,
      ],
```

### Basic use

```dart
TextFormField(
  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Name'),
  autovalidateMode: AutovalidateMode.always,
  validator: FormBuilderValidators.required(),
),
```

See [pud.dev example tab](https://pub.dev/packages/form_builder_validators/example) or [github code](example/lib/main.dart) for more details

### Especific uses

#### Composing multiple validators

`FormBuilderValidators` class comes with a very useful static function named `compose()` which takes a list of `FormFieldValidator` functions. Composing allows you to create once and reuse validation rules across multiple fields, widgets, or apps.

On validation, each validator is run, and if any one validator returns a non-null value (i.e., a String), validation fails, and the `errorText` for the field is set as the returned string.

Example:

```dart
TextFormField(
  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Age'),
  keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
  autovalidateMode: AutovalidateMode.always,
  validator: FormBuilderValidators.compose([
    /// Makes this field required
    FormBuilderValidators.required(),

    /// Ensures the value entered is numeric - with custom error message
    FormBuilderValidators.numeric(errorText: 'La edad debe ser num√©rica.'),

    /// Sets a maximum value of 70
    FormBuilderValidators.max(70),

    /// Include your own custom `FormFieldValidator` function, if you want
    /// Ensures positive values only. We could also have used `FormBuilderValidators.min(0)` instead
    (val) {
      final number = int.tryParse(val);
      if (number == null) return null;
      if (number < 0) return 'We cannot have a negative age';
      return null;
    }
  ]),
),
```

#### Add new supported language

We especially welcome efforts to internationalize/localize the package by translating the default validation `errorText` strings for built-in validation rules.

1.  Add ARB files

Create one ARB file inside the `lib/l10n` folder for each of the locales you need to add support. Name the files in the following way: `intl_<LOCALE_ISO_CODE>.arb`. For example: `intl_fr.arb` or `intl_fr_FR.arb`.

2. Translate the error messages

Duplicate the contents of `intl_messages.arb` (or any other ARB file) into your newly created ARB file, then translate the error messages by overwriting the default messages.

3. Generate localization code

To generate boilerplate code for localization, run the generate command inside the package directory where `pubspec.yaml` file is located:

`flutter pub run intl_utils:generate`

Running the command will automatically create/update files inside the `lib/localization` directory, including your newly added locale support.

4. Update README

Remember to update README, adding the new language (and language code) under [Supported languages section](#supported-languages) so that everyone knows your new language is now supported!

5. Submit PR

Submit your PR and be of help to millions of developers all over the world!
